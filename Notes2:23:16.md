 #### The Imperial Harem
 _**Power Structures**_
- lots of misconceptions about the nature of the harem; there is a big difference in modern views versus older views of public and private
- in republics there was a stronger sphere between public and private and in the private sphere is was normally women; however in Ottoman the lines weren't as clear
- private relations have an affect on the public sphere
- she was kept within imperial household but the public still had a lot invested in the royal mother and those members and the imperial household
- gender relations and constructions are implicated throughout power structures and regimes
- association of sexuality with political power
- when women stopped bearing children they gained their political power
- relationship between the inner and the outward; the more inward is more powerful
- inner and the outer

_** Dynasty**_
- sacralization of rulership is not unusual; we see it in both Persian and byzantine perceptions of governments
- some features of their dynastic politics that are particular to turko-mongolian politics
- dynasty is almost like a corporation that exists throughout time and everyone who is a part of it gets some share and there are very clear boundaries
- the state is really a function of the dynasty
- longest lived dynasty by far
- eungeniture - sons fighting
- expansion of bureaucracy in territorial democracy
- it is not all out way for dynastic politics since it is settling down in Istanbul
- changing make up of the areas that the ottomans rule; making it more of a consolidation into a band so that it would not affect much of the areas
- this seems to be a way to help contain war over power
- ** birth of demesta;  Lucette Valensi **
- voice of outsiders; letters that are not too abundant; court chronicles
- the centralization of the dynasty in Europe
- relationship between imperial harem and the larger  sphere ends up with a system of seniority and strong veziers
- heseki and validre sultan lose their power and declines about 1650

_** Age of the Queen Mother**_
- it becomes the validre sultan is the person who raised the current sultan and was their political handler until they came of age and the current sultan has a good reason to trust the queen mother
- heskie is a personal relationship and it is likely the following sultan did not necessarily have one figure who is as prominent in terms of influencing them
- validre sultan will have had years of networking and were originally heski and they have been operating in the palace corridors of power
- part of it was through her son who had more mobility than she did
- she controls entire harem and in charge of the entire system that involves nobles in the outside world
- royal princess is central figure of brockering between the harem and the outside world of power
- post sexual validre sultana could move around a bit more
- princess only get power once the marry
- depends on what they are doing for the dynasty
- the men may be more constrained and get paid less
