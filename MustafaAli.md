### notes: Mustafa Ali
- he was extremely descriptive with accusations and the details of their wrongs
- he was famous as a poet before he was famous as a historian
- there doesn't seem to be a standard form for advice books for sultans
 	- one of the first types of this book/ history
	- may have used poetry for communication more than common day
- dedication to the bureaucracy
- who is the real audience?
 	- grand vezirs and field marshalls
	- expose of all of the necessary information
- to what extent is Mustafa ali representative of the ottoman elite?
- sketch the vision of right order
	- who is hurt by this and who gains?
	- his vision has real political and social stakes for given groups
- provision of justice to ordinary people
- bureaucracy acts as the way to bring justice to the people
	- he is constantly putting ordinary people down
	- also trying to emphasize the provision of justice to ordinary people
	- as long as each individual can do their part and uphold the ideals than its ok
	-	the functioning of the chain depends on
		- he talks about how the field marshall had a lot of trust in his underling and the betrayal of the trust led to the catastrophe; there needs to be a mutual trust that is founded in something legitimate
		- emphasize discipline for the higher ranks
	- explicit about saying sultan is going to hell if he does not supervise his vezirs
	- sultan can not claim ignorance about what his vezirs are doing
	- the sultans role
	- mustafa ali is not totally amiss in wondering what role and how much the sultan knows what the vezirs are doing

	- Pierce just goes over big changes at the center
	- bureaucracy should be benefiting the people importance of philanthropic work in the royal family and the dynasty
		- talks about the corruption side
		- a dispute within a group of people who share a number of assumption about right order
		- pushing for price control and wants to eliminate the market failure and stuff that is going on
